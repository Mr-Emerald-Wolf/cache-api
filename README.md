# Caching Library for Go (Golang)

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/mr-emerald-wolf/caching-library)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/mr-emerald-wolf/caching-library)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mr-emerald-wolf/caching-library)](https://github.com/mr-emerald-wolf/caching-library/blob/main/LICENSE)

An in-memory caching library for general use in Go (Golang) that supports multiple standard eviction policies and allows the addition of custom eviction policies. The library ensures thread safety using mutexes to handle concurrent access.

## Features

- General-purpose in-memory caching library
- Support for three standard eviction policies: FIFO, LRU, and LIFO
- Option to add custom eviction policies
- Thread-safe caching with the use of mutexes
- Simple and easy-to-use API

## Installation

To use this caching library in your Go project, you need to have Go installed on your machine.

Use `go get` to install the library:

```bash
go get github.com/mr-emerald-wolf/cache-api
```

## Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use the caching library:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"

	"github.com/mr-emerald-wolf/cache-api"
)

func main() {
	// Create a cache with a capacity of 100 items and LRU eviction policy
	cache := caching.NewCache(100, caching.LRUEvictionPolicy{})

	// Add some data to the cache
	cache.Put("key1", "value1")
	cache.Put("key2", "value2")

	// Retrieve data from the cache
	value1, found := cache.Get("key1")
	if found {
		fmt.Println("Value for key1:", value1)
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Key1 not found in cache.")
	}

	// Wait for a moment to simulate cache expiration
	time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)

	// Retrieve data that has expired (for LRU policy, it will be removed)
	value2, found := cache.Get("key2")
	if found {
		fmt.Println("Value for key2:", value2)
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Key2 not found in cache.")
	}
}
```

## Eviction Policies

The caching library supports the following standard eviction policies:

- **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)**: The first item added to the cache will be the first one to be removed when the cache is full.
- **LRU (Least Recently Used)**: The least recently accessed item will be removed when the cache is full.
- **LIFO (Last-In-First-Out)**: The last item added to the cache will be the first one to be removed when the cache is full.

You can also add custom eviction policies by implementing the `caching.EvictionPolicy` interface.

## Thread Safety

The caching library is thread-safe and handles concurrent access using mutexes. You can safely use the cache from multiple goroutines without worrying about data corruption.
